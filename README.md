# Project 2

So, this is the second project from the course at
[Vue JS 2 - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/). I jumped from the project running
shown at the introduction to the final project, so it has certain differences from the suggested course, although
I think main functionality is the same:

- I used the standard HTML tag `progress`, instead of using one of the Bootstrap included elements, so the counter
is *outside* of the progress bar, in a new line.
- After analyzing the use, I decided to make a component *only* for the quotes; I wansn't going to reuse
any of the other parts of the page so I thought it wasn't worth the extra effort (the header, the quote grid, etc.)
- Had no clue what the fancy typeface was so... just used Comic Sans MS.
- There is no *hint* for deleting quotes. :shrugs:

Have fun with Vue JS!
